seerauber,🧭 SeeRäuber,Pirating Code,December 2018,https://github.com/plebeiathon/seerauber,,,,"<h3>The Idea</h3><p>In SeeRäuber, logical mastery is only the first chapter of the story. You write code to build ships, direct fleets, and govern an empire — but fate's hand, revealed through tarot, challenges your carefully laid plans. Each card draw brings new chaos, forcing you to adapt or embrace the unpredictable. Only those who balance logic and fortune will leave a lasting legacy.</p><h3>How It Works</h3><p>Built in Unity3D with C#, the game features a custom visual programming language — drag-and-drop code blocks with loops, conditionals, tasks, and variables that control your pirate crew's AI. Each pirate has simulated needs (hunger, thirst, sleep, sailing) and an interpreter evaluates your nested code blocks to generate task queues in real time. A state machine tracks day/night cycles, combat, and sailing conditions, while procedurally generated pirate names and Shakespearean insults bring the crew to life.</p><h3>The Grind</h3><p>We built an entire code interpreter from scratch in 24 hours — a recursive block evaluator that parses nested conditionals, loops, and boolean expressions to drive distributed pirate AI. Wiring up the drag-and-drop UI, the pirate need system, and the state machine into a cohesive game loop was a sprint, but we sailed out of SacHacks with a Second Place finish and a playable WebGL build.</p>"

## 🏗️ Site Architecture

[mutilar.github.io](https://mutilar.github.io) is itself an open-source project — a single-page app with zero build tools and zero frameworks.

![Site Architecture](images/mutilar-architecture.png)

| Layer | Details |
|---|---|
| **Rendering** | Dual-canvas parallax engine — coprime orb oscillations with per-section color palettes, blended via clip regions keyed to scroll position |
| **Design** | Glassmorphic tiles & bands via `backdrop-filter`, alternating transparent parallax windows and opaque content bands |
| **Data** | All section content lives in flat CSV files (`csv/`), parsed at runtime by [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/) — add a row and it appears on the site |
| **Modals** | Detail modal · MTG deck modal (full card art galleries from 100-card decklists) · MARP diagram + BOM modal · **Architecture modal** (system diagrams, module reference, data layer, visual pipeline & a11y docs) · PDF viewer (PDF.js spread-view for the Dusk Rose Codex) · WebGL game player modal · BitNaughts gallery modals |
| **Audio** | Integrated radio player with Web Audio API equalizer visualization, prev/next/play/pause, volume slider & mute |
| **Scroll** | IntersectionObserver reveal animations · scroll-hint fade-outs · active nav highlight with auto-scroll · brand label toggle |
| **A11y** | Skip-to-content link · focus trapping in modals · ARIA labels · `noscript` fallback · structured data (JSON-LD) · Open Graph & Twitter Cards |
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages from `master` — no CI needed · MIT licensed |

**Structure:** [`index.html`](https://github.com/Mutilar/mutilar.github.io/blob/master/index.html) · [`css/`](https://github.com/Mutilar/mutilar.github.io/tree/master/css) · [`js/`](https://github.com/Mutilar/mutilar.github.io/tree/master/js) (`parallax.js` · `scroll.js` · `modals.js` · `data.js` · `pdfviewer.js` · `radio.js`) · [`csv/`](https://github.com/Mutilar/mutilar.github.io/tree/master/csv) · [`images/`](https://github.com/Mutilar/mutilar.github.io/tree/master/images) · [`games/`](https://github.com/Mutilar/mutilar.github.io/tree/master/games)

marppi,🧠 marp.brain,"Raspberry Pi 5",,,https://github.com/Mutilar/MarpPi,"4-axis stepper control with dual input via USB joystick or Wi-Fi Direct UDP, low-latency H.264 video streaming, and auto-stop safety",,Raspberry Pi 5 controller for a 4-axis robot with 2 drive and 2 turret steppers using lgpio for precise timing. Supports seamless dual input — local USB joystick (Xbox) or UDP packets over Wi-Fi Direct from a Steam Deck — with automatic failover and a 1-second timeout safety stop on connection loss. Streams low-latency hardware-accelerated H.264 video via rpicam-vid and auto-starts all services on boot through systemd integration.
marpgamepad,🎮 marp.gamepad,"Valve Steamdeck",,,https://github.com/Mutilar/MarpGamepad,"Wireless teleoperation with real-time video feed, native Steam Deck and Xbox controller support via Unity's Input System",,Unity 6.0 client designed primarily for the Valve Steam Deck enabling wireless teleoperation of the MARP robot over a local Wi-Fi network. Controls the robot's mobility and turret movements with native support for Steam Deck and Xbox controllers via Unity's Input System. Receives and displays a real-time video feed from the robot's onboard Raspberry Pi camera for immersive first-person teleoperation.
